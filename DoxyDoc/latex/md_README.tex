\subsection*{About the author}

~~~~~~I am a French student, studying computer science engineering at I\+S\+I\+MA, France. I made this tool because I did not found a Catch like test tool in C. I hope you will enjoy using it, if you have any comment or advice, do not feel shy and tell me (by posting an issue \href{https://github.com/Klevh/LAssert/issues/new}{\tt here}) ! I will really appreciate it.
