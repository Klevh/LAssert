## About the author

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a French student, studying computer science engineering at ISIMA, France. 
I made this tool because I did not found a Catch like test tool in C. I hope you will enjoy using it, if you have any comment or advice, do not feel shy and tell me (by posting an issue [here](https://github.com/Klevh/LAssert/issues/new)) ! I will really appreciate it.
